# Evaluation Cards: Quickstart

*A stakeholder-agnostic guide to getting started. ~6 min.*

> **Heads up: Evaluation Cards is in Beta.** We'd love your feedback: report bugs, request features, or tell us what's confusing through our [feedback form](/feedback) or the [public roadmap](https://changemap.co/evaleval/evalcards/). You can reach the feedback form from any page via **Feedback** in the top navigation.

## What Evaluation Cards is

**Evaluation Cards** is a reporting layer over AI model evaluations, built by the [EvalEval Coalition](https://evalcards.evalevalai.com/about). It collects how AI models are evaluated across many benchmarks and reporting organizations, and also shows **what was left undocumented**.

A benchmark score on its own ("Model X scores 87% on MMLU") tells you very little. Evaluation Cards puts each score in context: *who* ran the evaluation, *how* it was set up, *whether* it can be reproduced, and *whether* it can be fairly compared to another score. The project treats every published evaluation as a **claim**, and every undisclosed detail as **a claim deliberately not made**. Neither is treated as an error.

At a glance (snapshot of June 2026), the corpus tracks:

| | |
|---|---|
| **5,816** models | **101,955** reported results |
| **31** reporting organizations | **820** model developers |
| **57** benchmark families | **632** single benchmarks |

> The corpus is **versioned by snapshot**. Every page shows a snapshot date. Numbers above will drift as the corpus grows, so always cite the snapshot you saw.

## The four interpretive signals

Every record is assessed against four signals. Learn to read them and most of the site falls into place.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `03-home-signals.png`**
> *What to capture:* The "Interpretive signals" section on the homepage (the four cards: Reproducibility, Completeness, Provenance, Comparability).

| Signal | Question it answers | What a low score means |
|---|---|---|
| **R · Reproducibility** | Could a third party re-run this evaluation? | Prompts, decoding settings, harness version, seeds, or code are undisclosed. |
| **C · Completeness** | Does the record meet normal reporting expectations for this kind of model? | Whole categories (e.g. safety, robustness, fairness) may be missing. |
| **P · Provenance & Risk** | Who ran it, and what real-world property does it measure? | Distinguishes **first-party** (the developer) from **third-party** (independent) evaluators. |
| **X · Comparability** | Can two scores on the same benchmark be put side by side? | Different splits, metric variants, or units make a direct ranking invalid. |

A high benchmark score with weak signals is still a weak claim. The signals are how you tell a well-documented result from one you can't check.

## The five-level hierarchy

Scores resolve through an explicit pathway, so any headline number can be drilled down to the evidence behind it:

```
Family  →  Composite  →  Single Benchmark  →  Split  →  Metric
```

For example: *MMLU (family) → MMLU-Pro (composite) → a single benchmark → a split (e.g. a particular subject or language subset) → accuracy (metric)*. When you see an aggregate claim, you can always click down to the specific metric supporting it.

## Getting around: the top navigation

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `02-home-hero.png`**
> *What to capture:* The top navigation bar (Overview · Models · Evaluations · Help · About · Feedback).

1. **Overview** (`/`): the corpus snapshot, the signals explained, and featured benchmark families. Start here.
2. **Models** (`/models`): every indexed model. Filter by parameter size, switch between **Models** and **Developers** views, and select up to four models to compare.
3. **Evaluations** (`/evals`): benchmarks grouped into **families**, filterable by interaction style (agent / non-agent) and ~17 categories (Mathematics, Safety, Software Engineering, …).
4. **Help** (`/help`): guides like this one, plus technical documentation on the signals and how to contribute data.
5. **About** (`/about`): how the signals are computed and the principles behind the corpus.
6. **Feedback** (`/feedback`): share feedback, request a feature, or report an issue.

## Your first 5 minutes

1. **Open a model page.** Go to **Models**, click any model (e.g. *Claude Opus 4.7*). This page is the model's evaluation record. Behind each number sits more than the page shows: the benchmark's own metadata and the evaluation run details, which is what actually makes the score interpretable.

   > 🖼️ **Screenshot — `13-card-summary-full.png`**
   > *What to capture:* A full model page in **Summary View** (e.g. `/models/anthropic/claude-opus-4.7`).

2. **Read the `DOCUMENTED` badge.** Near the top, a percentage (e.g. "36%, 14 / 39 reported") tells you for how many of the model's reported scores the **prompting/run setup is documented** well enough to re-run. The rest are missing details like temperature, max tokens, or the harness. (This is the model-level *Reproducibility* read; it's not about completed benchmark cards.) A low number here is common, and that's deliberate.

3. **Check "Who reports what" (§3).** A donut and per-category bars split results into **first-party** (the developer's own numbers) vs **third-party** (independent). This is your fastest read on how independent the evidence is.

   > 🖼️ **Screenshot — `17-card-who-reports.png`**
   > *What to capture:* The §3 "Who reports what" section of a model page (first-party vs third-party breakdown).

4. **Understand the Summary score.** In Summary View each benchmark is shown leaderboard-style, ranked against peer models. When a model has more than one reported result for a benchmark, the score shown is the **median** of all reported results.

   > 🖼️ **Screenshot — `18-card-metrics.png`**
   > *What to capture:* The §4 Reported metrics list in Summary View: benchmarks ranked best→worst with the model's score and peer rank.

5. **Switch to Researcher View.** The toggle in the bar at the top of the page swaps Summary for Researcher view, which exposes the underlying per-result detail. Use Summary to get oriented, and Researcher when you want to dig in.

   > 🖼️ **Screenshot — `23-reader-bar.png`**
   > *What to capture:* The Summary / Researcher View toggle at the top of a model page (the snapshot date sits at the right of the same bar).

   In Researcher View, §4 lists one row per benchmark with the number of results (**N**), the **mean and 95% CI**, and the **range** of reported scores. Expand a row to see each source's score, its generation settings, and the per-result **flags** showing which signals each result trips. That's the spread and provenance behind the summary number.

   > 🖼️ **Screenshot — `21-card-researcher-metrics.png`**
   > *What to capture:* An Overlaps row expanded to show each source's score, settings, and per-result flags.

6. **Note the snapshot date.** Every model and evaluation page shows a snapshot date in that same top bar (e.g. *Snapshot · Jun 9, 2026*), and the homepage shows it in the **Corpus snapshot** header. The corpus is versioned, so numbers change between snapshots. Cite the snapshot date with any figure so others can find exactly what you saw.

## Browsing evaluations

The **Evaluations** tab is the benchmark-first view. Benchmarks are grouped into **families** and tagged by category; filter by interaction style (agent / non-agent) or by category to narrow the list.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `05-evals-index.png`**
> *What to capture:* The Evaluations index, with families and their categories and counts.

Open a family to drill into its structure: the single benchmarks beneath it, their splits, and the metrics reported on each, following the same five-level hierarchy top-down.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `08-evals-family-expanded.png`**
> *What to capture:* A benchmark family opened to show its benchmarks and splits.

### Walk through one evaluation

Click a benchmark to open its own page. The **At a glance** card at the top summarizes what it measures, its main caveat, who it's intended for, and how to read it, with links to the source paper and dataset. Below sit the **Benchmark card** (schema, methodology, what it measures), **Technical details** (metric, completeness, comparability, splits), and a **"Can these scores be compared directly?"** panel.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `27-eval-detail-card.png`**
> *What to capture:* A benchmark's evaluation page, showing the "At a glance" card (measures · caveat · intended for · sources).

Scroll to **Reporting Comparison**: every model with a reported result on this benchmark, ranked, with the score distribution, the evaluator, the source, and the date. It's the benchmark-centric mirror of the §4 metrics on a model page.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `28-eval-detail-comparison.png`**
> *What to capture:* The Reporting Comparison leaderboard on a benchmark's evaluation page.

The chart above the leaderboard has two views, toggled at the top. **Distribution** shows how all the reported scores are spread across models; **Frontier** traces the best score over time, showing how the state of the art on this benchmark has advanced as newer models were released.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `29-eval-frontier.png`**
> *What to capture:* The Reporting Comparison chart in **Frontier** view (best score over time), with the Distribution / Frontier toggle.

## Three things to remember

- **A score is a claim, not a fact.** Read the signals before trusting the number.
- **First-party ≠ third-party.** Always check who produced a result.
- **Cite the snapshot.** The corpus is versioned; numbers change.
