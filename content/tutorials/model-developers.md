# Evaluation Cards for Model Developers

*How your model appears in the corpus, how to read what's documented vs. missing, and how to make your evaluation reporting stronger.*

> **Prerequisite:** the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) (~6 min) covers the four signals, the five-level hierarchy, and the snapshot model.

## Why you should care how your model is carded

Whatever you publish about your model's evaluations, Evaluation Cards re-presents it as a structured record alongside everyone else's, and also shows **what you did not disclose**. The project treats a published score as a **claim** and an undisclosed detail as **a claim deliberately not made** (not an error). That means your card is, in effect, a public read on how *legible* and *verifiable* your reporting is.

A high benchmark number with weak signals reads as a weak claim. Most of those gaps are cheap to close, and this guide is a checklist for doing so.

## Step 1: Find your model (and your org)

- **Models view** (`/models`): search for your model, filter by parameter range, and open its page.

  > 🖼️ **Screenshot — `09-models-index.png`**
  > *What to capture:* The Models index list.

- **Developers view**: toggle **Models → Developers** on the same page to see your organization's footprint across all its models.

  > 🖼️ **Screenshot — `22-developers-view.png`**
  > *What to capture:* The `/models` page with the **Developers** toggle active.

## Step 2: Read your page honestly

Open your model's page in **Summary View**, then switch to **Researcher View** to see the per-result detail others will scrutinize.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `13-card-summary-full.png`**
> *What to capture:* A full model page in Summary View.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `19-card-researcher-full.png`**
> *What to capture:* The same page after clicking **Researcher View**.

Three things to look at first:

1. **The `DOCUMENTED` badge** (e.g. "36%, 14 / 39 reported"). This is the headline read on your reporting hygiene: how much of your reported record is fully specified. Treat a low number as a backlog, not a verdict.

   > 🖼️ **Screenshot — `14-card-summary-top.png`**
   > *What to capture:* The page header with the DOCUMENTED badge.

2. **§1 Identification.** Confirm the basics are right: model name, developer, release date, modalities, system ID. Errors here propagate everywhere.

   > 🖼️ **Screenshot — `15-card-identification.png`**
   > *What to capture:* The §1 Identification block.

3. **§2 Benchmark coverage.** What categories are present, and where the **split spread** is. Gaps here are visible to everyone reading your page.

   > *What to capture:* The §2 Benchmark coverage section.

## Step 3: Work the four signals as a reporting checklist

Each signal maps to concrete, mostly low-cost actions.

### 🔁 Reproducibility: *make it re-runnable*
Disclose, per result: **setup variants, prompts, decoding parameters, harness name + version, random seeds, and code/artifacts**. Corpus-wide only ~3% of scores have complete setup documentation, so even modest disclosure stands out.

- ✅ Publish the exact harness + version (e.g. the eval framework and commit).
- ✅ State decoding settings (temperature, top-p, max tokens) and seeds.
- ✅ Link runnable code or a config, not just a number.

### 📋 Completeness: *cover the categories that matter*
Completeness is judged relative to expectations for your model class. A strong **capability** record that is silent on **safety**, **robustness**, or **fairness** reads as incomplete.

- ✅ Report beyond the flattering capability benchmarks.
- ✅ If a category is intentionally out of scope, the absence will still show, so consider documenting why.

### 👤 Provenance & Risk: *invite independent evaluation*
Your page splits results into **first-party** (your own) vs **third-party** (independent), and maps results to **IBM Risk Atlas** risk domains. A category that is **entirely first-party** is a visible blind spot: impressive, but uncorroborated.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `17-card-who-reports.png`**
> *What to capture:* The §3 "Who reports what" first-party vs third-party breakdown.

- ✅ Encourage / enable third-party evaluation, especially for safety-relevant claims.
- ✅ Don't expect self-reported numbers alone to carry weight with careful readers.

### ⚖️ Comparability: *report so your scores can be compared*
The site flags when two scores on the same benchmark used different splits, metric variants, or units, which invalidates direct comparison.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `18-card-metrics.png`**
> *What to capture:* The §4 Reported metrics section with benchmark charts.

- ✅ Use the standard splits and metric definitions for each benchmark.
- ✅ State units explicitly; don't silently switch metric variants.
- ✅ Use the **Evaluations** page to see how others report the same benchmark family.

  > 🖼️ **Screenshot — `08-evals-family-expanded.png`**
  > *What to capture:* A benchmark family detail page (e.g. `/evals?family=artificial-analysis`).

## Step 4: Corrections and snapshots

The corpus follows **snapshot discipline**: no retroactive edits, only versioned corrections. Practically:

- A number you published is attributed to its source document and tied to a dated snapshot, so it won't be silently rewritten.
- If something is genuinely wrong or missing, the path is a **correction in a future snapshot**, not an edit-in-place. Keep your own source documents stable and clearly dated so they can be cited cleanly.
- Because nothing is imputed, the fastest way to improve your page is simply to **report more, and report it precisely**, and the corpus will reflect it on the next snapshot.

## A pre-launch checklist

Before your next model announcement, check that each headline benchmark claim ships with:

- [ ] Harness name + version, and a link to runnable code/config
- [ ] Decoding settings and seeds
- [ ] The exact split and metric (with units), matching how the benchmark is normally reported
- [ ] Coverage beyond capability: at least some safety / robustness / fairness results
- [ ] At least one path to independent (third-party) evaluation for key claims
- [ ] A stable, dated source document for every number

Closing these is what moves your `DOCUMENTED` percentage, and turns marketing numbers into claims that hold up.
