# Evaluation Cards for Evaluation Researchers

*How to use Evaluation Cards as a working tool for studying, auditing, and comparing model evaluations.*

> **Prerequisite:** skim the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) first for the four signals and the five-level hierarchy.

## Why this matters for your work

If you study evaluations, you already know the core problem: published benchmark numbers are rarely accompanied by the prompts, decoding settings, harness versions, seeds, or evaluator identity needed to interpret or reproduce them. Evaluation Cards canonicalizes heterogeneous reporting into a single structured corpus where the **absence** of those details is recorded explicitly rather than silently dropped.

The design principles that matter most for research use:

- **Every score is attributed to its source document.** Provenance is first-class.
- **Missing values are never imputed.** A blank is "not reported," never a guessed number.
- **Evaluator identity is preserved.** First-party and third-party results are kept distinct.
- **Snapshot discipline.** No retroactive edits; corrections are versioned. Your analyses are reproducible against a dated snapshot.

Some of our next steps are aimed squarely at research use, including making **all evaluation data, metadata plus run-level results, downloadable** directly from Evaluation Cards. In the meantime, run-level data is available from [Every Eval Ever](https://github.com/evaleval/every_eval_ever), the structured datastore that powers the corpus. If there's a feature that would help your work, tell us on the [public roadmap](https://changemap.co/evaleval/evalcards/). We'd love to build what the research community needs, so let us know.

## The Researcher View

The model page has two modes, toggled top-right. Use **Summary View** to get oriented, and **Researcher View** to do the actual work.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `19-card-researcher-full.png`**
> *What to capture:* A model page (e.g. `/models/anthropic/claude-opus-4.7`) after clicking **Researcher View**, showing the expanded per-result detail.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `20-card-researcher-top.png`**
> *What to capture:* The top of the Researcher View (the view toggle + the documentation summary line).

Researcher View exposes the per-result granularity behind the summary aggregates: setup variants, splits, metric paths, source harnesses, and the document each number came from.

## Working through the page, section by section

A model page is organized into four numbered sections.

### §1 Identification
Model name, developer, release date, modalities (e.g. *image, text → text*), system ID, and last-updated. The stable identifier (`ec/models/<dev>/<model>`) is what you cite.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `15-card-identification.png`**
> *What to capture:* The §1 Identification block of a model page.

### §2 Benchmark coverage
A benchmark-first view grouped by category, surfacing **setup spread** and **split-vs-setup** differences up front. Watch the "split spread" note (e.g. *"2 benchmarks include multiple splits or setups"*). These are exactly the cases where naïve aggregation hides variance.

> *What to capture:* The §2 Benchmark coverage section.

### §3 Who reports what
A first-party / third-party split as a donut plus per-category bars. This is the provenance signal made concrete. In the captured example (*Claude Opus 4.7*, 39 results): **12 first-party (31%)** vs **27 third-party (69%)**, with per-category breakdowns (e.g. *Finance: 0 first-party · 3 third-party*; *Multimodal Input: 2 · 2*).

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `17-card-who-reports.png`**
> *What to capture:* The §3 "Who reports what" section.

For research: a category that is **entirely first-party** is a known blind spot: there is no independent corroboration of those numbers.

### §4 Reported metrics
This is where you read off the actual numbers. In Researcher View the section has a grouping toggle for **Overlaps**, **Category**, and **Source**, plus a family selector, a search box, and a grid/list switch. Each grouping answers a different question.

**Overlaps** gives one row per benchmark, with the **mean and 95% CI** across this model's appearances and the **range** of reported scores (plus a Δ for how far the numbers move). Expand any row to see each source's score, its generation settings, and the per-result **flags** for the signals that result trips. The **All / Overlaps only** filter narrows the list to benchmarks reported by more than one source, where divergence is easiest to spot.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `24-research-overlaps.png`**
> *What to capture:* §4 in **Overlaps** grouping with a row expanded, showing each source's score, settings, and per-result flags.

**Category** regroups every reported result under curated category tags, so similar benchmarks cluster across families. Read the model's profile by capability area (math, safety, agentic, …) rather than by benchmark name.

> 🖼️ **Screenshot — `25-research-category.png`**
> *What to capture:* §4 in **Category** grouping.

**Source** is the warehouse's natural shape: family-rooted plots and accordions with no cross-family collapse. This is the full result set; drill into any plot for the per-result setup context. (The section opens in Overlaps when a model has any; switch here for everything.)

## Reading the four signals rigorously

| Signal | What to inspect | Research caution |
|---|---|---|
| **Reproducibility** | Disclosure of setup variants, prompts, decoding params, harness version, seeds, code availability. | "Reproducible in principle" ≠ "reproduced." Only ~3% of scores have complete setup documentation corpus-wide. |
| **Completeness** | Coverage across capability / robustness / safety / fairness for the model class. | A complete *capability* record can still be silent on safety. Completeness is relative to expectations, not absolute. |
| **Provenance & Risk** | First- vs third-party; mapping to **IBM Risk Atlas** risk domains. | First-party numbers are not wrong, but they are not independent. Check §3 before ranking. |
| **Comparability** | Split, metric variant, and unit differences within the same benchmark. | Two "MMLU" numbers may use different splits or metrics, flagged here. Do not rank across incomparable setups. |

## Comparing models and benchmarks

- **Models index** (`/models`): filter by parameter range (`< 1B` … `> 500B`, presets at 8B/12B/32B/128B, plus an *Unknown size* option), and toggle **Models ↔ Developers**.

  > 🖼️ **Screenshot — `10-models-controls.png`**
  > *What to capture:* The Models index controls (parameter slider, Models/Developers toggle, "selected to compare" counter).

- **Side-by-side compare:** select up to four models via the **Add to compare** buttons.
  > ⚠️ *As of this writing the populated compare view is intermittently unavailable on the beta backend (cold-start errors). If it fails, retry after a few seconds.*

- **Evaluations index** (`/evals`): families filterable by **interaction style** (agent / non-agent) and category. Drill into a family at `/evals?family=<slug>` to see its benchmarks → splits → metrics.

  > 🖼️ **Screenshot — `08-evals-family-expanded.png`**
  > *What to capture:* A benchmark family detail page (e.g. `/evals?family=artificial-analysis`) showing its benchmarks and splits.

## Limitations

1. **Comparability is bounded by setup.** The site flags when two scores under the same benchmark are not directly comparable, so respect those flags in any ranking or meta-analysis.
2. **Coverage ≠ quality.** Many results with weak documentation can look like "good coverage." Weight by the signals.
3. **The corpus reflects what was reported, not all that exists.** Undisclosed evaluations are absent by definition.
4. **Pin a snapshot.** Cite `ec/models/...` identifiers plus the snapshot date so your analysis is reproducible.
